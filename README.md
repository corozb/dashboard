# Dashboard

<hr>
In this project I have learned: 
- How to build a dashboard layout using CSS Grid & Flexbox.
- Special rules for dynamic content blocks using repeat, auto-fit, min-max, column-count , grid-gap, and column-gap.
- The right way to write mobile-first, responsive CSS using graduating min-width media queries.
- How to build a sliding, mobile-responsive side nav.

Also:
Includes a clickable, sliding side nav with accordion list items, a nice dropdown user menu, and some slick transition hover action.
